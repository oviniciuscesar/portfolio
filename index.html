              <li><strong>Year:</strong> 2022</li>
              <li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> Classical guitar and live electronics</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="composition-description">
                The title of the piece refers to the work <em>Do corpo ao pó: crônicas da territorialidade Kaiowá e Guarani nas adjacências da morte</em>, by anthropologist Bruno Morais, 
                which addresses the genocide of the Kaiowá and Guarani peoples in Mato Grosso do Sul and explores their relationships with the land and the body, whether alive or dead, as inseparable aspects of territoriality. 
                Morais investigates two concepts of territory: the first, rooted in the indigenous vision, and the second, the expression <em>tekoha</em>, affected by state policies that imposed specific borders on these peoples. 
                Bringing this poetic image to the context of the creation, the aim was to evoke metaphors that refer to these relationships as well as to the notion of territoriality described above. 
                Whether in the relationships established between interactive processes and instrumental gestures or in the structuring and development of musical materials at the micro and macro levels, 
                different developments of this metaphor were used in the conception of the piece.

            </ul>
            <p class="composition-description">
              <em>Eutropia I</em>, for solo flute, is the first in a series of five pieces for different instruments and ensembles ranging from solo instruments and duos to small chamber groups and live electronics. 
              The conception of Eutropia I, as well as the other pieces in this cycle, is based on the poetic image created by Italo Calvino in <em>Invisible Cities</em>. 
              <em>Eutropia</em>, one of the cities described by Marco Polo to Emperor Kublai Khan, is actually five cities, of which only one is inhabited at a time. 
              Each time its inhabitants move to one of the empty neighboring cities. Along with this move, new relationships are established between its inhabitants and between the new city. 
              Each of the five pieces in the cycle will function as one of the five cities, one unfolding and transforming itself from the materials of the previous one through processes of rewriting; 
              citation; translation; expansion; unfolding; transcription; commentary; and reflection, among others, carried out on the original material itself and also on the compositional process as a whole.

            </ul>
            <p class="composition-description">
                <em>MetaMorfema</em> was composed between February and August 2017 and premiered on November 16 of the same year by the Unicamp Symphony Orchestra, during the “Young Musicians OSU” concert. 
                The work won the Young Musicians OSU competition in 2017. Its poetic concept is based on a brief fragment from the beginning of the first movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, reinterpreted here as a “morpheme” — 
                the smallest unit capable of expressing meaning, about the term from linguistics. The proposal was to transform this fragment to generate new materials that, despite the metamorphoses, would preserve certain original characteristics. 
                The piece develops through various types of transformation applied to the initial fragment, such as expansion, contraction, rhythmic rotation, and retrogradation. It is from this process of metamorphosis of the “compositional atom” 
                that the title <em>MetaMorpheme</em> emerges, in allusion to the act of transformation that structures the work.

                <li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> Trombone and live electronics</li>
                <li><strong>Premiere:</strong> November 23, 2017</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="composition-description">
                Composed between December 2016 and April 2017, <em>Espasmos</em> is dedicated to trombonist Daniel Soares. The piece explores the proliferation of small impulses and gestures, performed by the trombone and transformed in real time by live electronics. 
                The trombone's melodic material undergoes contractions and expansions, being processed and spatialized in four channels around the audience. The work's title refers to these brief gestures and impulses, marked by constant temporal and melodic variations. 
                The electronics interact with the instrumental writing on three distinct levels: spectral, structural, and spatial. On the spectral plane, there is real-time processing of the trombone's sound spectrum; on the structural plane, the electronics construct 
                the entire last section of the piece from processed sounds of the instrument; on the spatial plane, these sounds are projected in quadraphonic space. The instrumental writing is based on harmonic-melodic material derived from a Gesualdo melody, manipulated through Pousseur's harmonic networks to generate new materials. 
                These materials are then subjected to variations, being expanded and contracted in different registers, preserving their intervallic relationships. Real-time electronics use four main types of processing of the trombone sound: spectral delay, 
                freeze, harmonizer, time stretch, and granular processes, each associated with specific spatial trajectories.

                (Re)Synthesis explores the idea of music creation as a process that is developed in three phases: perception, analysis, and synthesis. This concept guided the choice and development of the materials that structure the work. 
                The initial material for this piece was inspired by a harmonic set of notes taken from a work by Pierre Boulez. This harmonic structure stands out in the texture of the composition, marking the starting point for perception. 
                From this element, the sonic possibilities of the harmonic group were explored in a process of analysis, revealing its potential. Based on Markov chain techniques, this original material was transformed, resulting in a new structure, 
                which served as the main material for the synthesis — and composition of the piece. However, this is not a simple citation, but a creative process in which archetypes are transformed to give rise to new structures while preserving 
                a reference to their origin — a process of “(Re)Synthesis”. What was previously, in Boulez, a harmonic aggregate, here assumes a new identity within a distinct universe.

                Since the advent of real-time computer music environments, composers have increasingly incorporated DSP analysis, synthesis, and processing algorithms in their creative practices. 
                Those processes became part of interactive systems that use real-time computational tools in musical compositions that explore diverse techniques to generate, spatialize, and process instrumental/vocal sounds. 
                Parallel to the development of these tools and the expansion of DSP methods, new techniques focused on sound/musical information extraction became part of the tools available for music composition. 
                In this context, this article discusses the creative use of Machine Listening and Musical Information Retrieval techniques applied in the composition of live-electronics works. 
                By pointing out some practical applications and creative approaches, we aim to circumscribe, in a general way, the strategies for employing Machine Listening and Music Information Retrieval 
                techniques observed in a set of live-electronics pieces, categorizing four compositional approaches, namely: mapping, triggering, scoring, and procedural paradigms of application of 
                machine listening techniques in the context of live-electronics music compositions.

                Tools and their technical frameworks impact directly the compositional processes, thus, placing itself as an element of fundamental importance, 
                either in the conception of poetic ideas and images or in the technical realization of a work. In this sense, the present work aims to discuss some aspects of the correlation between technics, 
                poetics, aesthetics, and musical writing in the context of interactive/live-electronics music. This takes place from a dialogue between the ideas of authors and composers, 
                such as Gilbert Simondon, Helmut Lachenmann, and Pierre Boulez about technical frameworks and their implications in musical practice. 
                Thus, we aim to discuss the interrelation between technological devices, musical elements, and poetic images, which are established within the compositional process. 
                These reflections will serve as a theoretical field to introduce and describe some characteristics about compositional thinking of two-piece: 
                “Espasmos” (2017), for trombone and liveelectronics, by Vinicius Cesar, and “Caminhos queue Levam” (2018), for clarinet and live-electronics, by Thales Roel.

                This paper aims to reflect on processes and mechanisms that can operate in musical creation, from the conception of a subjective idea to a possible accomplishment. 
                Therefore, we seek a dialogue between the notion of "solfège" and the four moments of Gilbert Simondon’s "image cycle" (2016): 
                (1) image-anticipation,(2) lived experience, (3) image-memory, and (4) invention. At the same time, bringing these reflections to the technical dimension of composition, 
                we propose a dialogue between an “imaginaryinstrument” (Lachenmann, 1996; Padovani, 2017) and a “technical object” (Simondon, 2020), addressing technological tools and several creative supports, 
                and illustrating some of the ideas through our compositional process.

                The present work consists of a study about compositional strategies in the use of Machine Listening (ML) and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) techniques applied to live-electronic music, proposing a technical, contextual, and creative study. 
                The research starts from a theoretical foundation that seeks to discuss and contextualize the emergence and development of the ML and MIR as interdisciplinary research fields, as well as approaches concepts related to interactive musical systems, 
                interactive music and emphlive-electronics. The theoretical foundation also extends to the review of a set of techniques, processes, and tools, aiming to elucidate the main concepts in the implementation of ML/MIR methods. 
                Subsequently, the investigative study covers some general observations about the main characteristics of musical writing in interactive music/live-electronics associated with the use of the studied tools. 
                With that, we point out some practical applications and compositional approaches in a set of pieces from the repertoire. 
                Finally, the last part of the work discusses the creative process of a composition for acoustic guitar and live-electronics, approaching particular strategies for employing ML/MIR techniques.

                Amid the repercussions of historical colonization processes, the concepts ofcoloniality and modernity exert a deep influence over collective and individual constructs.Despite transforming these processes into different manifestations, 
                coloniality persists as alatent force of domination capable of shaping collective thought at multiple layers.Consequently, musical practice as a component of these layers incorporates theirparadigms,
                 affecting listening, education, and even sound and music imaginary. This textseeks to propose discussions within the context of contemporary music, delving into howthe phenomenon of coloniality underscores compositional practices. 
                 In parallel, itaddresses the search for decolonial ways while simultaneously problematizing the idea ofclosed and definitive solutions. So that, we elucidate the concepts of colonization,coloniality, decoloniality, and modernity, contextualizing them within the domain ofmusical practices. 
                 Subsequently, we evaluate possible decolonial ways and thecontradictions that arise when we adopt this posture in music creation through specificexamples from contemporary music scenarios and our musical compositions.

                In this paper, we present an analysis of the compositional processes of Sequenza VII and itsdevelopments in Chemins IV, from the melodic/harmonic point of view. 
                Theoretical references are: theprinciple of chromatic complementarity of Catherine Losada; the typology created by Henry Pousseur;Albert Lautman's concept of continuous space; 
                Max Packer's idea of latency and resonance in Berio's work;and Edmound Costère's Law of Universal Attraction. A patch in MAX / MSP environment was createdto assist in obtaining the analytical results. 
                As final considerations, it is clear that the process of melodicstructuring of the oboe in Sequenza VII is the trigger of a harmonic unfolding process in Chemins IV.

              This text seeks to describe the various moments that occur in the compositional process, from the conception of a certain subjective idea to its concreteness. 
              We will draw a parallel between the notion of “solfeggio” and the four moments of Gilbert Simondon's “cycle of images”: 1) image-anticipation, 2) lived experience, 3) image-memory, and, finally, 4) invention. 
              At the same time, in dialogue with the notions of “imaginary instrument” (LACHENMANN, 1996; PADOVANI, 2017) and “technical object” (SIMONDON, 2020), we will investigate the technical dimension of composition, 
              dealing with creative, technological tools, and different creation supports.

              Since the advent of real-time computer music environments, composers have increasingly incorporated DSP analysis, synthesis, and processing algorithms in their creative practices. 
              Those processes became part of interactive systems that use real-time computational tools in musical compositions that explore diverse techniques to generate, spatialize, and process instrumental/vocal sounds. 
              Parallel to the development of these tools and the expansion of DSP methods, new techniques focused on sound/musical information extraction became part of the tools available for music composition. 
              In this context, this article discusses the creative use of Machine Listening and Musical Information Retrieval techniques applied in the composition of live-electronics works. 
              By pointing out some practical applications and creative approaches, we aim to circumscribe, in a general way, the strategies for employing Machine Listening and Music Information Retrieval techniques 
              observed in a set of live-electronics pieces, categorizing four compositional approaches: namely, mapping, triggering, scoring, and procedural paradigms of application of machine listening techniques in the context of live-electronics music compositions.

              The paper aims to define and map the strategies of technical expansion of musical instruments in the context of interactive mixed music. This is realized from observations about Tensio (2010), 
              for string quartet and real-time electronic processes, by Philippe Manoury. The text starts from the notion of expanded instrument dialoguing with propositions of authors/composers such as Helmut Lachenmann, 
              Johnathan Harvey and Manoury, and identifies three modes of technical expansion of the musical instruments in the piece.

          <h3>Perceptron<h3>
          <p class="composition-description">
            The <em>perceptron</em> is an artificial neuron model, created by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958, capable of automatically "learning" which are the ideal values of weights w that, 
            when weighting the inputs x, transmit the signal (returning the value 1) or not (returning the value 0) depending on the nature of the input data (input signal). 
            In the context of machine learning, such an algorithm is used to solve binary classification and linear regression.
            This implementation is the result of a study of the creative appropriation of machine learning algorithms in the context of live-electornics music composition. 
            Therefore, it presents some functions that are not in the original algorithm created by Rosenblat.

            The object receives a list of features of up to three dimensions and maps the topology of the input data. Once the network is trained, it receives a list of features and outputs the nearest neuron's weights for each input.

            <em>som</em> is part of a broader research aiming at the creative appropriation of <em>machine learning</em> algorithms in the context of live electronic music. 
            It includes some features not present in typical SOM implementations, such as a negative learning rate (allowing the object to "unlearn" data topology) and a probability factor (to control probabilistic selection of neurons).
